# COMP3322-finalProject

This is the final project of course COMP3322 (Modern Technologies on World Wide Web)

## Project Overview
In this project, I am designing and implementing an online music store for customers to purchase music songs according to their preferences. In the project, the website is implemented using different techniques which include both the client side and the server side. The website consists of a few web pages for collecting users’ input on the client-side and passing the data to the server-side for processing. A database schema is also designed specifically to meet the requirements of this project.

## Objectives
1. A learning activity to support ILO 2 (implement web-based systems to solve real-life problems.).
2. The goals of this programming project are:
• to get solid experience in using client-side, server-side techniques and database systemto design and implement a web-based application which contains some common features of an online music store;
• to get a good understanding of how the layout of a web-based application can be implemented by using CSS and responsive design.

## Project Outline
- **Part I**: Implement the functionalities of the system, which mainly contains the following parts: the main page, the login/logout page, the create account page, the refine by category function, the search bar function, the cart function, the checkout page, and the invoice page. It is expected that the abovementioned pages and functions are created by the client- side and the server-side technologies and you can use any client-side and server-side technologies that were learnt in this course. Please note that in the example shown in this specification, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (optional jQuery), MySQL, AJAX, and PHP are used as the client and server side technologies but you are welcome to use other technologies which were learnt in this course.
- **Part II**: Design the layout of the web pages by using CSS and responsive web design. It is expected that in this part, the website should have the feature of responsive web and modern CSS design.
